    "## Bond Duration\n",
    "In bond analysis, it is common to use yield instead of the interest rate. Duration measures the bond's sensitivity to changes in yield, which relates directly to price. Note the duration is often less than the duration of the maturity. The longer the duration is, the higher risk it will have against the change of the interest rate. There are two commonly used types of duration: **Macaulay duration** and **modified duration**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Macaulay duration is the weighted average time to receive the bond's cash flows, considering the yield. Suppose a financial instrument makes payments $m$ times per year, with the payment in period being $c_k$, and there are $n$ periods remaining. The Macaulay duration is defined as:\n",
