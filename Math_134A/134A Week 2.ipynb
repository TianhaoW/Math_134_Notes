The well is to be operated over 5 years, producing the estimated quantities shown in the following table. It is estimated that the oil will be sold for 20 per barrel. The net income is also shown. \n",

The allowance is deducted from the net income to determine the taxable income. The investor is in the 45\\% tax bracket.\n",

    "**Problem 17** (An erroneous analysis) A division of ABBOX Corporation has developed the concept of a new product. Production of the product would require 10 million in initial capital expenditure. It is anticipated that 1 million units would be sold each year for 5 years, and then the product would be obsolete and production would cease. Each year’s production would require 10,000 hours of labor and 100 tons of raw material. Currently, the average wage rate is 30 per hour and the cost of the raw material is 100 per ton. The product would sell for 3.30 per unit, and this price is expected to be maintained (in real terms). ABBOX management likes to use a 12% discount rate for projects of this type and faces a 34\\% tax rate on profit. The initial capital expenditure can be depreciated in a straight line fashion over 5 years. In its first analysis of this project, management did not apply inflation factors to the extrapolated revenues and operating costs. What present value did they obtain? How would the answer change if an inflation rate of 4\\% were applied? \n"
