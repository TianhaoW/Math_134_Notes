    "Consider a call option and a put option written on the same underlying asset with price $S_t$, with the same strike price and also same expiry date $T$. Suppose the risk-free factor is $r$. Then the price of call option and put option $C_t, P_t$ satisfies\n",

Then its payoff at time $T$ is $$(S_T-K)^+ -(K-S_T)^+ = S_T-K.$$ Consider another portfolio of long a share of stock and short $Ke^{-r(T-t)}$ in the bank, then the payoff at time $T$ is also $S_T-K$. Since those two portfolio have the same payoff at time $T$, their value at time $t$ must also be the same by the no arbitrage principle. Hence, we get $C_t-P_t = S_t-Ke^{-r(T-t)}$"
